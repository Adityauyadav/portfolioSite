        <h2 class="blog-title">Expression - a fear?</h2>
        <p class="blog-date">29 March, 2025</p>
        <p>People say that those who express are the strongest, but I believe that no, not every time. Sometimes, expressing is the weakest form of handling. The more you express, the more you are preventing yourself from actually thinking on your own.</p>

        <p>Think of it like this: at that time, your thoughts are a room of darkness, and instead of just passing by, you are expressing, which only distracts you, like when a doctor distracts a kid while giving him an injection. When you think about the injection, you feel the pain, but it is actually a lot better when you are not thinking of it.</p>

        <p>You may have noticed that when a kid is taken for an injection and he knows it, he starts talking a lot. That is not really him speaking, it is his fear of the pain. It happens to me too. I always start randomly scrolling on my phone whenever I am getting a blood test or an injection, not because I fear needles, but because I do not want to focus on it. It is not necessary to deliberately feel everything. Why make things hard when it can be easy? And that is exactly what expression is when you are expressing at the time of emotional baggage.</p>

        <p>So, expression is not always a strength. Sometimes, it is an avoidance.</p>
