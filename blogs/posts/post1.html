        <p class="blog-date">7 Jun, 2024</p>
        <p>
            I was pondering this issue in the post-Covid-19 era and considering the significant changes 
            that have occurred in the world, particularly among GenZ.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been nearly three years since the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 
            lockdowns that followed. During this time, we gradually increased our dependency a bit more 
            than pre-covid era on the digital platforms, leading to increased introspection and contemplation about life. 
            It was a period of deep reflection for individuals around me and people worldwide. However, this introspection didn't 
            necessarily lead to positive outcomes for all. Some experienced mental health challenges, while others misinterpreted their own struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward to 2023, and I want to highlight a trend I've been observing. When you search for the definition of “depression” on Google, you'll find that it refers to a group of conditions related to changes in a person's mood. These conditions include clinical depression, bipolar disorder, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar II disorder, postpartum depression, and more. At first glance, this seems reasonable. So, what's the issue, and why am I addressing it?
        </p>
        <p>
            I recall that in June 2020, the digital world was filled with messages about the importance of discussing mental health openly, and the need to break the taboo surrounding it. To a certain extent, the world did listen, and the stigma around mental health started to change. But what has happened since then?
        </p>
        <p>
            In my view, Generation Z took the information and openness about mental health to an extreme, but in the wrong direction. Some misunderstood it as an opportunity to emphasize their own problems and to avoid dealing with life's challenges. As the title suggests, it appears that many are eager to declare themselves as "being depressed." I'm a part of GenZ too, born in '02, and I've certainly been surrounded by peers who have embraced this trend. One of the advantages that our generation has gained from the digital world is that while we were walking, the internet taught us to run, and we haven’t stopped since. We’re constantly on the move, and our faithful companions are the various social media platforms, be it Facebook, Instagram, X, Reddit, Tumblr, or others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, many individuals tend to overly romanticize the idea of being depressed. They convince themselves that they are experiencing depression, that their lives are miserable, and that nothing good is happening to them. However, if you revisit Google's definition of depression, you'll notice a crucial word there — “mood.” Problems and challenges affect everyone in various ways, understandably impacting one's mood. But does that necessarily mean you are in depression? Does it mean that nothing good is happening in your life?
        </p>
        <p>
            This brings us to an important question: Why, in a generation with abundant resources at our fingertips, do we often find ourselves declaring even minor issues as sources of misery? I've observed individuals engaging in discussions about whose life is more challenging or who is facing greater problems, but the question remains: why? Why do some people feel the need to win an argument over life's hardships?
        </p>
        <p>
            I once read that our generation doesn't need motivation; we need clarity. The abundance of resources has paradoxically led to a scarcity of clear paths. Perhaps individuals who think their lives are miserable should shift their perspective from how miserable their lives are to why they feel this way and whether it's genuinely warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it is crucial to destigmatize mental health issues and promote open conversations, it is even more important to help individuals differentiate between the emotions tied to life's challenges and real mental health issues. The problem should be grounded in reality rather than romanticized in the realm of exaggeration. The more we lead individuals to believe they are depressed when they might not be, the more we risk our generation adopting a weakened mindset.
