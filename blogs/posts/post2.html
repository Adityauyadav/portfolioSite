        <h2 class="blog-title">Life on track</h2>
        <p class="blog-date">15 Nov, 2024</p>
        <p>I often come across Instagram reels and Facebook posts about taking control of our lives and getting back on track. Whether from niche pages or influencers’ quotes, the message feels repetitive. It makes me wonder: are we truly so far off track that we need this effort to “get back”? A train can only be “back on track” if it has been off, so are we really derailed?</p>

        <p>If we are off track, the real question is: when did it happen, and how? Did someone push us off, or did we wander off on our own? Looking back, I see mistakes I’ve made—times I thought, “I shouldn’t have done this,” or “Maybe I should’ve done that.” But isn’t that how it always goes? We look back and feel we could’ve done better.</p>

        <p>I remember preparing for my board exams. I took private English lessons, inspired by my elder siblings who had learned from a passionate teacher I admired. Those two months became some of the best learning experiences of my school life, focusing on growth rather than just marks. For the record, I ended up scoring 95/100 in English. Thank you, sir!</p>

        <p>He’d ask me random questions while teaching—about English and life in general. One day, he asked, “Adi, why do so many people want to go back in time and relive certain moments?” I had no answer then and shrugged it off, but later that night, I realized that people don’t want to relive the past; they want to return with the knowledge they have now. If we could go back just to be kids again, we’d likely make the same mistakes and end up wondering the same things.</p>

        <p>It reminds me of the movie <em>Groundhog Day</em>, where Phil, the main character, is stuck reliving the same day. Initially, he repeats his mistakes, thinking small changes will work, but nothing does. Only when he learns from his experiences does the loop finally break. Imagine if we could go back without learning—we’d be like Phil, stuck in our loops, never moving forward. It’s not the past we long for, but the chance to use what we know now to make it better.</p>

        <p>But when did we get off track, and why do we feel the need to get back? The truth is, we never really got off track; we’ve always been on it. The real issue isn’t whether we’re on the right path but how our train is moving along it, including the unnecessary stops we make. We pause at stations we shouldn’t, wasting time.</p>

        <p>Some might say, “Life isn’t a race,” and they’re right; we don’t need to keep up with anyone else’s pace. However, maintaining our own pace is equally important. While we shouldn’t compete, we do need to keep moving because nature doesn’t wait for anyone. The sunrise doesn’t pause for the climber, and the sunset doesn’t hold off for the bird flying home. Time moves forward, regardless of our circumstances.</p>

        <p>When people talk about taking control of their lives or getting back on track, it often boils down to understanding the urgency of time. Eventually, we come to terms with this need for “timeliness.” Someone who resists waking up early may start when their job demands it. Someone struggling to focus may sharpen it when they need money. But sometimes, this realization comes too late.</p>

        <p>What good is it to recognize the importance of consistency for competitive exams after the attempts have passed? You might see the need for change too late to act on it. It’s a classic irony of life.</p>

        <p>It’s easy to assume that this person’s life is off track because he missed opportunities. However, he may simply not have kept pace with their reality. Had he recognized the need for change a bit sooner, things might have been different.</p>

        <p>If I were to ask, “What if I could send you back to your past self? What would you do?” they’d probably say they’d make those chances count. That’s the point: we may want to revisit the past, but only if we can bring our current realizations with us. Rather than focusing on “getting back on track,” we should concentrate on keeping our train moving purposefully in the present.</p>
